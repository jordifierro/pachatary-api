<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.</p>

<h3>Basic Terms</h3>

<p>Therefore, "the content" are the images, texts and locations you use to create "experiences" and "scenes" inside the app (so content does not include personal information like email).</p>
<p>All the content you generate will be public.</p>
<p>You or the owner of the content keeps it after posting it, we don't ask for any kind ownership of it.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the content you post.</p>
<p>Content cannot be offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste. Examples of such content include:<p>
<ul>
    <li>Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.</li>
    <li>Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence.</li>
    <li>Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms.</li>
    <li>Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as "explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."</li>
    <li>Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.</li>
    <li>False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers. Stating that the app is “for entertainment purposes” won’t overcome this guideline.</li>
    <li>Content that inflinges copyright.</li>
</ul>

<p>Content that doesn't accomplish that will be removed from the app.</p>
<p>Users that publish such content can also be expelled from the app.</p>

<p>Pachatary is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.</p>

<p>With respect to Pachatary’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Pachatary accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for that system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Pachatary does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h3>

<p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
