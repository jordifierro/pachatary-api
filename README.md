## Documentation

This project has been developed using Django framework,
with Postgres as database and S3 as storage service.

Code structure follows a Clean Architecture approach
([explained in detail here](http://jordifierro.com/django-clean-architecture)),
emphasizing on code readability, responsibility decoupling
and unit testing.

## Setup

Follow these instructions to start working locally on the project:

* Download code cloning this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordifierro/abidria-api.git
```
* Install postgres and run:
```bash
./abidria/setup/postgres.sh
```
to create user and database.
* Run postgres:
```bash
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres &
```
* Install python version specified on `runtime.txt`
and run:
```bash
virtualenv -p `which python3.6` ../env
```
* Get into the environment:
```bash
source ../env/bin/activate
```
and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Migrate database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
* Create django admin super user:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
* Finally, you should be able to run unit and integration tests:
```bash
pytest                # python tests
python manage.py test # django tests
```

Once we have made the first time setup,
we can start everything up running:
```bash
source abidria/setup/startup.sh
```
